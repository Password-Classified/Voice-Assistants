This collection of voice assistants includes many different computer assistants, inspired by intelligent home smartspeakers such as [**Alexa**](https://developer.amazon.com/en-GB/alexa/) or [**Google Nest**](https://store.google.com/gb/category/connected_home?) devices. I have taken inspiration from various places, such as the computers in films, tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtube.com).

Within this repository, we have many different assistants. Here is a description of them below.

------------------

## [Basic Assistant](https://github.com/Password-Classified/Voice-Assistants/tree/master/Basic%20Assistant)

<br/>

After following a NeuralNine YouTube tutorial, I created this assistant that follows basic commands, but is quite slow.

## [Computer Assistant](https://github.com/Password-Classified/Voice-Assistants/tree/master/Computer%20Assistant)

<br/>

Inspired by the [Star Trek](https://startrek.com) computer consoles such as [here](https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Computer) which are referenced to as *"Computer"*, I created a voice assistant in such a style.

<br/>

## [Jarvis Assistant](https://github.com/Password-Classified/Voice-Assistants/tree/master/Jarvis%20Assistant)

<br/>

Inspired by the Marvel computer Jarvis, this is a similar assistant to the others.
