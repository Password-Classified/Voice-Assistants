This collection of voice assistants includes many different computer assistants, inspired by intelligent home smartspeakers such as [**Alexa**](https://developer.amazon.com/en-GB/alexa/) or [**Google Nest**](https://store.google.com/gb/category/connected_home?) devices. I have taken inspiration from various places, such as the computers in films, tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtube.com).

Within this repository, we have many different assistants. Here is a description of them below.
