This collection of voice assistants includes many different computer assistants, inspired by intelligent home smartspeakers such as [**Alexa**](https://developer.amazon.com/en-GB/alexa/) or [**Google Nest**](https://store.google.com/gb/category/connected_home?) devices. I have taken inspiration from various places, such as the computers in films, tutorials on [YouTube](https://youtube.com).

Within this repository, we have many different assistants. Here is a description of them below.

Inspired by the Star Trek computer, this is my assistant. Refer to as "computer".

After following a NeuralNine YouTube tutorial, I created this assistant that follows basic commands, but is quite slow.

## [Helpful Assistant](https://github.com/Password-Classified/Voice-Assistants/tree/master/helpful-assistant)

A helpful assistant.
